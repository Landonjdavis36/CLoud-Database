# Overview

For the program that I wrote. It uses a cloud database("Firestore") to retrieve, collected, select, update, and delete data. The data that it collects is your name, city, state, and zip code so I could use that data in future projects esspically location based. What it uses is a zip code enetered to refrence, store and pull the data. Which creates a new list in the database.
